INSTALATION:
------------

Copy the content in /bin folder to your rootfs folder, make sure to have opencv, gstreamer and gtk installed.

CROSS-COMPILING:
------------

1 - get into ltib shell: ./ltib -m shell
2 - make
3 - the binary is placed in /bin folder


THE DEMO:
------------

This demo is currently working with 2 gestures, opened hand that enables control and closed hand  that disables control.
If you want to modify the code and use more gestures, it can recognize up to 5 gestures, as shown: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quKW-H56kNk

the video of this demo running: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-uxVBOIXEI

Also, the code is not clean, so, some work is still needed on it.

TROUBLESHOTS
------------

1 - make sure to have the gpu driver correctly installed before running the application (if it was not installed as built-in, you can lsmod it) to avoid segmentation fault.
2 - the capture resolution must be 320x240, in OpenCV-1.1.0 the cvSetCaptureProperty () function is not working properly so it must be hardcoded in OpenCV source.

HARDCODING CAPTURE RESOLUTION
-----------------------------

1 - (kwrite/gedit/vi) .../opencv-1.1.0/otherlibs/highgui/cvcap_v4l.cpp
2 - change line 231 from 640 to 320
3 - change line 232 from 480 to 240
4 - rebuild opencv
5 - resintall opencv
